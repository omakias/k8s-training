Example how to set resource on pods

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: db
â€¦..
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"



----------RESOURCE QUOTA-----------------
limits.cpu	              Across all pods in a non-terminal state, the sum of CPU limits cannot exceed this value.
limits.memory	            Across all pods in a non-terminal state, the sum of memory limits cannot exceed this value.
requests.cpu	            Across all pods in a non-terminal state, the sum of CPU requests cannot exceed this value.
requests.memory	          Across all pods in a non-terminal state, the sum of memory requests cannot exceed this value.
hugepages-<size>	        Across all pods in a non-terminal state, the number of huge page requests of the specified size cannot exceed this value.
cpu	Same as requests.cpu
memory	Same as requests.memory
