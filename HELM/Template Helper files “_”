Template helper files: Most files in templates/ are treated as if they contain Kubernetes manifests with one exception - NOTES.txt [tbd]
But files whose name begins with an underscore (_) are assumed to not have a manifest inside. 
These files are not rendered to Kubernetes object definitions, but are available everywhere within other chart templates for use.

These files are used to store partials and helpers. In fact, when we first created mychart, we saw a file called _helpers.tpl. That file is the default location for template partials

Inside those files we can use an action called define. With it we can create a named template INSIDE of a template file and than pull inject it and it’s content to a template file we’ve built.
Its syntax goes like this

{{ define "MY.NAME" }}
  # body of template here
{{ end }}
